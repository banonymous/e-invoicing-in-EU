Receiving e-invoices business process
Electronic invoicing is the exchange of an electronic invoice document between a supplier and a buyer. An electronic invoice (e-Invoice) is an invoice that has been issued, transmitted and received in a structured data format which allows for its automatic and electronic processing, as defined in Directive 2014/55/EU.

European Committee for Standardization (CEN) developed standard EN-16931 for electronic invoicing at the request of the European Commission following the Directive 2014/55/EU.

Regulatory preconditions
Several EU countries are now mandating B2B companies to adopt e-invoicing. 
Serbia, for instance, has already enforced mandatory e-invoicing in the B2B sector since January 1, 2023.

Belgium is poised to introduce mandatory B2B e-invoicing and e-reporting starting July 2024. The country's Minister of Finance has outlined the plan, likely implemented through Peppol. The rollout will be gradual, beginning with large taxpayers being mandated to issue e-invoices in July 2024, followed by medium-sized taxpayers in January 2025, and ultimately extending to all taxpayers by July 2025. This phased approach aligns with the EU guidelines set forth in the ViDA framework, promoting interoperability among data exchange systems across EU member states.

Belgium will introduce mandatory B2B e-invoicing and e-reporting from July 2024 
The Belgian Minister of Finance has announced the intention to introduce mandatory B2B e-invoicing from July 2024, most likely through Peppol (see below). The introduction will be phased and related to Belgian established companies with turnover over the threshold. Belgium will also introduce Continuous Transactions Controls with the goal to have a pre-filled VAT Return.
For the deployment of this system, Belgium intends to follow the EU guidelines, as published in the framework of the ViDA, thus promoting the interoperability of data exchange systems between EU countries. The obligations will be introduced in stages:

July 2024: every taxpayer needs to be able to receive an e-invoice;

July 2024: issuance of e-invoices by large taxpayers;

January 2025: issuance of e-invoices by medium-sized taxpayers;

July 2025: issuance of e-invoices by the rest of the taxpayers

Technical details
The main part of the European standard on e-Invoicing (EN) is the semantic data model (EN 16931-1) and its business rules.

The EN does not define the technical structure (syntax) of the electronic invoice but instead uses two international XML message standards to carry the information defined in the core invoice data model. The European standard specifies how the information in the core invoice must be mapped into each message standard. The syntaxes supported are 

the widespread UBL 2.1 Invoice message (which is being supported by PEPPOL) 

and the UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice (CII) message.
